## Why I Built This Engineering Portfolio  

This site exists for one reason: **to show how I build real systems.**

I’m a senior Linux and infrastructure engineer transitioning into **Cloud, Platform engineering** through hands-on projects, structured training, and production-style implementations. Rather than keeping that work private, I’m documenting it in public — not as a learning diary, but as a **working technical portfolio**.

The DataTalksClub Data Engineering Zoomcamp is one of the structured programs guiding this journey, but the scope of this blog goes far beyond a single course. Here you’ll find cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, data platforms, automation workflows, and AI experiments built on Linux-based systems.

## The Platform Behind This Site  

This site itself is a real DevOps project.

It is built and deployed using:

- **Jekyll** — static site generator used in production environments  
- **Chirpy** — a developer-focused theme with CI/CD and SEO built in  
- **GitHub Actions** — full CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments  
- **GitHub Pages** — cloud hosting with automated publishing  

Every commit triggers a build, dependency resolution, static site compilation, and deployment — just like a production delivery pipeline.

## What I Solved to Make It Work  

Getting this site live wasn’t just clicking “enable GitHub Pages.” It required:

- Understanding Jekyll’s configuration model and project structure  
- Integrating the Chirpy theme into a GitHub Pages–compatible pipeline  
- Configuring GitHub Actions to handle Ruby dependencies and builds  
- Debugging YAML, bundler, and CI failures caused by small syntax and config issues  
- Rebuilding broken pipelines and restoring stable deployments  

These are the same types of problems that appear in real DevOps and platform engineering work: dependency conflicts, CI failures, environment mismatches, and brittle configuration.

Fixing them required careful debugging, reproducibility, and automation — exactly the mindset needed for cloud engineering.

## What This Blog Will Contain  

This is not a course notebook.  
This is a **portfolio of working systems.**

Here you’ll see:

- Cloud infrastructure built with **Terraform**
- Data platforms using **BigQuery, Spark, Mage, and dbt**
- CI/CD pipelines and automation with **GitHub Actions**
- Linux-based deployments
- MLOps and AI workflow experiments  

Some projects will be guided by the DataTalks Zoomcamp. Others will be independent builds designed to mimic production engineering environments.

## My Posts

Every post here will tie back to:
- Architecture  
- Automation  
- Reliability  
- Reproducibility  
- Real engineering decisions  

This blog is how I demonstrate technical skills in **Linux infrastructure**, **Cloud, Platform engineering** with public, verifiable work.

## What’s Next  

The first major build starts with **containerized data pipelines and infrastructure as code** — using Docker and Terraform to deploy real cloud-hosted systems.

From there, this portfolio will grow into full cloud platforms, CI/CD pipelines, and AI-driven workflows.

This is the first commit in that journey.
