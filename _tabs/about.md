# Hi, I’m Zoyia Melton 👋  

### From Linux Infrastructure to Cloud, DevOps & MLOps 🚀  

I’m a senior Linux and infrastructure engineer transitioning into **Cloud, DevOps, and Platform engineering** through hands-on projects, certifications, and production-style systems. After years of building and operating enterprise platforms, I’m now focused on designing, automating, and scaling modern cloud and data systems.

This site is my technical portfolio — a place where I document **real systems I build**, not just coursework.

---

### 🛠 Why Cloud, DevOps/MLOps & Platform Engineering?  

My career has always centered on keeping critical systems reliable, secure, and scalable. That same mindset now drives how I approach cloud platforms, CI/CD pipelines, data infrastructure, and machine learning workflows.  

Instead of only maintaining servers, I now build:
- Cloud infrastructure with **Terraform**
- Automated delivery pipelines with **GitHub Actions**
- Data platforms with **BigQuery, Spark, and Mage**
- MLOps and AI workflows that run on Linux-based cloud systems  

My goal is to combine deep infrastructure experience with modern cloud and data tooling to create **production-grade platforms**.

---

### 🧰 My Technical Toolkit  

I work across the full stack of modern engineering platforms:

- **Linux & Automation:** RHEL, Ubuntu, Bash, Python  
- **Containers & Orchestration:** Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes  
- **Cloud & IaC:** GCP, AWS, Terraform  
- **Data & MLOps:** BigQuery, Spark, Mage, dbt, ML pipelines  
- **CI/CD & DevOps:** GitHub Actions, automation, monitoring

### 🧪 What I’m Building  

This blog documents my journey through structured training like the **DataTalksClub Data Engineering Zoomcamp** along with independent projects that reflect real-world engineering work, including:

- Cloud-hosted data pipelines  
- Infrastructure-as-code deployments  
- CI/CD workflows  
- Scalable data platforms  
- AI and MLOps experiments  

Every post is designed to show **how systems are built, deployed, and operated**, not just how tools are installed.
