# Hi, I'm Zoyia Melton 👋

## From Systems to Streams 🚀

I am an **Infrastructure Engineer & Linux System Administrator** with a deep background in managing stable, scalable systems. Currently, I am expanding my expertise into the world of **Data Engineering** through the **DataTalksClub DE Zoomcamp**.

### 🛠️ Why Data Engineering?
Throughout my career as a Linux Admin, I've managed the servers that hold the data. Now, I’m moving "up the stack" to architect the pipelines that move, transform, and analyze it. My goal is to combine my infrastructure "muscles" with modern data tooling to build production-grade data platforms.

### 🏗️ My Technical Toolkit
Coming from an Infrastructure background, I specialize in:
* **OS & Scripting:** Expert Linux Administration (RHEL/Ubuntu), Bash, and Python.
* **Virtualization & Containers:** Docker, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes.
* **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform (the backbone of my DE Zoomcamp labs).
* **Cloud:** GCP/AWS environment hardening and resource management.

### 🎓 The Zoomcamp Journey
I am currently documenting my progress on this blog as I master:
1. **Containerized Data Ingestion** (Docker & Postgres)
2. **Infrastructure Provisioning** (Terraform)
3. **Workflow Orchestration** (Mage/Airflow)
4. **Data Warehousing** (BigQuery & dbt)
5. **Distributed Processing** (Spark & Kafka)
